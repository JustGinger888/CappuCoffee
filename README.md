The deliverables for this assessment will be a single pdf document containing a 2000-word report. It is not
academic in style, and you should use markdown to create the document. I consider 2000 words to be a rough
estimate, and your report may be anything from between 1000 to 2000 words in length.
The document should, roughly, be structure as follows:
Link to your hosted web application.
Link to your hosted Git Repository (ensure it is public, or if on GitHub you can add me - joeappleton18),
which should include a:
Professional README.md file. This file should contain information on how to run the project in
development and production.
Your project's, version-controlled, source files
This should pull together, and summarize, the entire project. You should also include the background and
inspiration that lead you to undertake this project. You may, at this point, want to pull in statistics to underpin
your argument as to why this project was required.
A high-level overview of how the system functions, you can use screen shots if it helps. You should consider
aspects such as:
Briefly describing all datastores including databases, file systems and media data stores
Key views and interfaces
Including a diagram of the key system components and how they are linked
Deliverables
Title and Cover Page
Introduction
System Overview
Key Design Decisions
You should rationalize the choices you made in designing your application.
This section will document the different database entities and how they are related. If you are using a relational
database you may want to include an entity relationship diagram.
Identify in what ways your application is secure and scalable.
Bring the document to a close by tying together the process, and provide me with a brief reflective account of
the entire project.
